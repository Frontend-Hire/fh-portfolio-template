Yes, there are various reasons to do so. One of the most common ones is to trigger a build or deployment.

Just use the flag "--allow-empty" and it will allow you to create an empty commit.

```sh
git commit --allow-empty -m "fix: empty commit for deployment"

[main 9869338] fix: empty commit for deployment
```
